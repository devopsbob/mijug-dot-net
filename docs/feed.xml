Mainframes, workstations, PCs, Macs, microcomputers, and minicomputers were all defined by their chipsets. Companies like IBM, Sun Microsystems, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, and Apple created hardware that was compatible with specific operating systems.</p>

<h3 id="chips">Chips</h3>

<p>Fast forward to 2025, and chip technology has advanced dramatically. Central processing units (CPUs) have become faster, with names like i5, i7, CoreDuo, and M1. Meanwhile, graphical processing units (GPUs), originally designed for gaming and rendering, are now essential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This rapid evolution has driven a relentless pace of change, particularly in security.</p>

<h3 id="the-security-race">The Security Race</h3>

<p>As computing power increases, so does the ability to crack passwords. Tasks that once required a single home computer can now be accomplished faster with rented cloud computers‚Äîor even multiple rented computers across cloud providers. This has necessitated the development of new security measures, such as the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip, which is a minimum requirement for Windows 11.</p>

<h4 id="trusted-platform-module---tpm">Trusted Platform Module - TPM</h4>

<p>Do you have a TPM chip in your current PC? Maybe. You‚Äôll need to check via an internet connection and a Windows 10 update to find out. But why is a TPM chip so important? The answer lies in quantum computing. Quantum technology is on the horizon, promising to process data at speeds that could render traditional security measures obsolete. A task that might take thousands of computers days or years to complete could be done in seconds with quantum computing.</p>

<h3 id="why-keep-your-old-computer">Why Keep Your Old Computer?</h3>

<p>While new security requirements may render older computers unsuitable for sensitive tasks like banking or business, they can still serve a purpose. Many everyday activities‚Äîlike playing music, viewing photos, or casual gaming‚Äîdon‚Äôt require the latest security features. Repurposing your old computer for these non-sensitive tasks can provide significant value:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduce Electronic Waste</strong>: Reusing your old computer delays the need to dispose of it, helping to reduce e-waste.</li>
  <li><strong>Transition Gracefully</strong>: Use your old computer as a staging ground to offload, back up, and format data before moving to a new device.</li>
  <li><strong>Extend Its Life</strong>: Repurpose your old investment for new uses:
    <ul>
      <li>Let grandkids play games on it.</li>
      <li>Turn it into a garage PC for music and video.</li>
      <li>Use it for anonymous internet browsing to reduce tracking and targeted ads on your primary devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Reusing older computers is not just about nostalgia‚Äîit‚Äôs a practical way to maximize your investment, reduce waste, and adapt to changing technology. While they may no longer meet the demands of modern security, these devices still have plenty of life left for everyday, non-sensitive tasks. So before you toss that old PC, consider how it might still serve you in 2025 and beyond.</p>]]></content><author><name>Bob Kranson</name></author><category term="linux" /><category term="cpus" /><category term="gpus" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keeping your chips out of the wood chipper]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.mijug.net/assets/logo-mijug-watermark-98x100.svg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.mijug.net/assets/logo-mijug-watermark-98x100.svg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to MIJUG.NET!</title><link href="https://www.mijug.net/announcements/2025/07/03/welcome-to-mijug-dot-net.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to MIJUG.NET!" /><published>2025-07-03T15:05:55-04:00</published><updated>2025-07-30T22:54:37-04:00</updated><id>https://www.mijug.net/announcements/2025/07/03/welcome-to-mijug-dot-net</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.mijug.net/announcements/2025/07/03/welcome-to-mijug-dot-net.html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="hello">Hello!</h3>
