Welcome to **My Information Just Under Glass**!

In coming weeks **MIJUG** will be presenting a seminar series to assist DIY'ers and those less technically saavy to convert their existing non-Windows 10 supported computers into Linux.

The objective will be to person-to-person engage and explain the what, how, why you would convert your non-Windows-11-compliant computer to Linux.

As a seasoned veteran of the Information Technology space I have previously taught at Wayne State University in Detroit, created and managed technology user group(s), and enabled many career-changers during the pandemic.

The seminar series will be delivered in-person only. The content will not be recorded or provided directly via this website. This website will be a landing zone for additional helpful tips, references, or tools. One of the objectives is to provide a "human-in-the-loop" to assist others to recycle their older computers thereby reducing e-waste and providing a basic internet enabled desktop computer for grandkids, casual internet surfing, or low-impact (ie not gaming) application support for the common user.
