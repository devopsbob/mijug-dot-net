Welcome to **My Information Just Under Glass (MIJUG)**!

This fall of 2025, **MIJUG** will host an in-person seminar series designed to help DIY enthusiasts and less tech-savvy individuals convert their older, non-Windows-11-compliant computers into Linux-based systems.

### Why Attend?
The seminar series aims to provide hands-on guidance and practical knowledge about:
- **What** Linux is and how it can replace unsupported Windows systems.
- **How** to perform the conversion process step-by-step.
- **Why** switching to Linux is a sustainable and cost-effective solution.

### About the Presenter
As a seasoned IT professional, I bring years of experience in teaching, mentoring, and enabling career transitions:
- Former instructor at Wayne State University in Detroit.
- Founder and manager of multiple technology user groups.
- Mentor to career-changers during the pandemic.

### What to Expect
The seminars will be delivered **in-person only** and will not be recorded or made available online. However, this website will serve as a resource hub, offering:
- Helpful tips.
- References.
- Tools to support your Linux conversion journey.

### Our Mission
One of the key objectives of this initiative is to reduce e-waste by repurposing older computers. By converting them into Linux-based systems, you can:
- Provide a functional desktop for grandkids or casual internet use.
- Enable basic application support for non-gaming purposes.
- Contribute to a more sustainable future by recycling outdated hardware.

Stay tuned for more updates and resources to help you get started!
