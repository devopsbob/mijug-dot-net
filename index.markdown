Welcome to **My Information Just Under Glass (MIJUG)**!

This fall of 2025, **MIJUG** is excited to host an in-person seminar series designed to empower DIY enthusiasts and non-technical individuals to convert their older, non-Windows-11-compliant computers into Linux-based systems.

### Why Attend?
Our seminar series offers hands-on guidance and practical knowledge to help you:
- **Understand** what Linux is and how it can replace unsupported Windows systems.
- **Learn** the step-by-step process to convert your computer to Linux.
- **Discover** why switching to Linux is a sustainable and cost-effective solution.

### About the Presenter
With years of experience in IT and education, I am passionate about helping others embrace technology. My background includes:
- Teaching as a former instructor at Wayne State University in Detroit.
- Founding and managing multiple technology user groups.
- Mentoring career-changers during the pandemic to help them transition into tech roles.

### What to Expect
The seminars will be delivered **in-person only** and will not be recorded or made available online. However, this website will serve as your go-to resource hub, providing:

### Our Mission
At MIJUG, we aim to reduce e-waste by repurposing older computers. By converting them into Linux-based systems, you can:

- Enable basic application support for non-gaming purposes.
- Contribute to a more sustainable future by recycling outdated hardware.
