## My Information Just Under Glass - Network

### Origins

This domain was originally created to support the Michigan Java Users Group (MIJUG). I established it in 2002 while working at Compuware Corporation, where I supported OptimalJ, a tool that ran on Java 5.

### Vision

**My Information Just Under Glass - Network** reflects the `.net` top-level domain (TLD) and serves as a platform to share insights and knowledge I’ve gathered throughout my career. The name symbolizes my perspective—information viewed through my "looking glass."

The name may seem obscure, but it holds personal significance. It reminds me of the [Get Smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Smart) television show, where Maxwell Smart and the Chief communicate in a glass dome to preserve secrecy—[The Crowded Cone of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxmEtJ31Ldw). The irony is that they are in separate glass containers and cannot hear each other! Similarly, the asynchronous nature of the internet has transformed communication into a series of muted exchanges and potential misunderstandings.

### Meaning Behind the Name

- **"Under Glass"**: Represents the secure and intentional exchange of information, akin to viewing something through a protective barrier.
- **"Just Under"**: Reflects the idea that this information is being consumed through a monitor or screen, a modern "glass window."
- **"My Information"**: Highlights that the content shared here is curated from my experiences and published with positive intent.

This site is a personal endeavor to share knowledge, foster understanding, and provide value to those who seek it. Thank you for visiting!
